## Every word the player reads, in plain or doctrinal language.
##
## Doctrinal terms follow US doctrine:
## - JP 3-85, Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (2020): electromagnetic
##   support (ES), attack (EA), protection (EP); emission control (EMCON);
##   direction finding (DF).
## - JP 3-14, Space Operations (2018, Change 1 2020): space situational awareness
##   (SSA); the Space Force (SFDD-1, 2025) now says space domain awareness (SDA).
## - JP 3-60, Joint Targeting: find, fix, track, target, engage, assess (F2T2EA).
## - USSF, Space Warfighting: A Framework for Planners (2025): counterspace as
##   orbital, electromagnetic and cyberspace warfare; space link interdiction;
##   active defense (escort, counterattack) and passive defense (threat warning,
##   military deception). Counterspace effects are reversible or nonreversible
##   (USSF framework pp. 5, 9): deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, destroy (JP 3-14
##   GL-5, negation).
## Blue is the U.S. Space Corps (fiction, modelled on the Space Force's Deltas 2,
## 3, 7 and 9) with its CSpO and NATO partners. Red is unflagged.
## Plain language says the same thing in everyday words. The game is the same
## either way; only the words change.
