# Physics verification

Every piece of physics xGEO uses is checked against something that can be verified without trusting the game: a maintained, citable library, JPL data, a published worked example, or a Monte Carlo of the physical process itself. The suite tests **the game's own numbers**. Godot evaluates its own GDScript functions and writes the results out. Python never reimplements the game in order to grade it.

```
node tools/verify.mjs              # dump Core's physics, then run the suite and print the table
node tools/verify.mjs -k moons     # extra arguments go to pytest
```

The first run creates `tools/verify/.venv` from `tools/verify/requirements.txt` (it needs Python 3.12 or later; on Windows, `winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12`). Every later run works offline: JPL data is cached in `tools/verify/fixtures/`. The full table is written to `tools/verify/out/results.md` and `results.json`.

Result on 26 Oct 2026 (Godot 4.7.2), in the full repository: **762 of 762 comparisons within tolerance, 63 tests passed**, plus 4 INFO rows for known simplifications. On xGEO Core alone (the published folder, with no scenario file): **550 of 550 within tolerance, 57 tests passed**, 2 INFO rows; the 6 tests of the effects (jammer, uplink turnaround, pointing, laser, HPM, kill probability) skip there, because their parameters come from a scenario file. On 25 Oct 2026: 762 of 762, 63 tests. (On 23 Oct 2026: 359 of 359, 51 tests, 16 INFO.)

## How it works

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/verify/fetch_fixtures.py` | Run once, online. Fetches JPL Horizons state vectors for Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (relative to Jupiter, ICRF, TDB) at J2000, across the campaign window (2041-03-14 + 20 d, 2 h steps) and across 2036–2046 (1 d steps), plus the GM values from the body headers and JPL's mean-element table (JUP365). It stores both the raw API text and a parsed copy. |
| `tools/verify/fixtures/published_values.json` | Published constants and standards, each with its citation and URL: Juno gravity (Durante 2020, Iess 2018, Folkner 2017), the IAU 2015 pole, ITU-R P.525, CCSDS 401 turnaround, DSN 810-005 bands, the monopulse slope, and the beamwidth rule. |
| `tools/verify/make_cases.py` | Writes `fixtures/cases.json`, a deterministic grid of inputs: orbits from circular to e = 0.999 and hyperbolic, 3-D and retrograde, long- and short-way Lambert transfers, points around Jupiter, RF parameters from S to Ka band, random lines of sight, tracker states, bearing-line geometries, and the published worked examples. |
| `godot/tests/dump_physics.gd` | **The bridge.** It runs every case through `godot/core/*.gd` and adds cases built from the live campaign (every ship, every sensor, emitter, radar and weapon class in `game.json` and `campaign.json`). It writes `tools/verify/out/game_physics.json`. It computes nothing itself. |
| `tools/verify/tests/test_*.py` | Compare the dump with the references. Each comparison is recorded with its tolerance (`conftest.py`: `check.rel`, `check.abs`, `check.bound`, `check.true`, and `check.info` for known simplifications). |
| `tools/verify/refs.py` | Reference models assembled from hapsira and scipy (the force model, DOP853 integration, the two-body STM). Its one transcription of game code is the moon ephemeris, which drives the reference integrator. It is tested against the game's own moon states before it is used. |

**Plugging in a new model.** The IR, sidelobe, ear-pointing and heat models are due to be replaced (REALISM-SOURCES.md §8). To add a replacement:
1. Add a section to `dump_physics.gd` that calls the new functions on a grid of inputs and on the campaign platforms.
2. Add a `tests/test_<model>.py` that compares the output with an independent reference (astropy `BlackBody` in-band integration, ITU-R envelopes, a Monte Carlo of the detector) using `check.*`.
3. Turn the current INFO rows into `check.rel` or `check.bound` once the model they describe has been replaced.

### Galilean moons against JPL Horizons

The game's moons are planar Kepler ellipses built from JPL's mean elements. The mean longitude advances at the observed sidereal period (NASA Jovian satellite fact sheet) and the mean anomaly at JPL's tabulated period P (`anomalisticPeriodDays`), so the periapsis precesses at the difference between the two. JPL's legend calls P the sidereal period; the game uses it as the mean-anomaly period because, with the fact-sheet sidereal periods, that reproduces Horizons (`test_moons.py`). The implied apsidal periods match JPL's "P apsis" for Io (1.333 yr) and roughly for Europa (1.333 vs 1.394 yr), but not for Ganymede (135 vs 68.3 yr) or Callisto (536 vs 278 yr), a simplification bounded by the errors below. The frame is Jupiter's equator (IAU 2015 pole), with x pointing at its ascending node on the ICRF equator. The game's J2000 longitudes match Horizons in that frame to within 0.06–0.7°.

| Moon | Planar position error, campaign window | Longitude error | 2036–2046 longitude error | Out-of-plane (ignored) | Bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Io | 2,970 km | 0.40° | 0.43° | 340 km | 5,000 km, 0.7° |
| Europa | 1,230 km | 0.10° | 0.24° | 5,370 km | 5,000 km, 0.5° |
| Ganymede | 6,400 km | 0.34° | 0.38° | 2,490 km | 10,000 km, 0.6° |
| Callisto | 23,200 km | 0.71° | 0.72° | 9,900 km | 30,000 km, 1.0° |

The mean-longitude rates agree with a least-squares fit to 10 years of Horizons positions to 1.4e-7 (Callisto 1e-6). The Laplace angle λ_I − 3λ_E + 2λ_G follows Horizons to within 1.1°.

## Fixes made to the game

Each fix was made in GDScript and in the JS mirror where one exists. The exporter was then re-run.

**Player-facing changes, listed first:**

| # | What | Before | After | Player effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Moon ephemeris** (`Kepler.from_elements`, `positionFromElements`, `MOONS`). The mean motion came from Kepler's third law, √(μ/a³), which ignores J2 and the Laplace resonance. It now uses the observed sidereal period for the mean longitude and JPL's tabulated period for the mean anomaly. | Longitude error vs Horizons at the campaign start: Io 114°, Europa 1.6°, Ganymede 34.4°, Callisto 21.4° | 0.40°, 0.10°, 0.34°, 0.71° | **Significant.** At the start, Ganymede (and with it the scenario, which is laid out relative to Ganymede) sits 34° further round, Callisto 21° and Io 114°. Relative to Ganymede, Callisto (the handler) moves 13° and the civil traffic (absolute phases) 34°. The Godot tests still pass (73/0, 8/0). HYDRA's week-long moon perturbation changed from 825 km to 1,998 km. The scripted intercept still closes, at 33 km against 23 km before (the limit is 50 km). |
| 2 | **Interferometer DF σ** (`RF.df_sigma`, `dfSigma`). The phase CRB 1/√(2·SNR) was being fed the integrated radiometer SNR. For an unknown signal, the cross-correlation phase error is (1 + 2s)/(2Bτs²) ≈ 1/(2·SNR²) (confirmed by Monte Carlo). | 12 m baseline, X band: 106 / 61 / 19 µrad at SNR 10 / 30 / 300 (with the 20 µrad floor: 107 / 64 / 28) | 33 / 11 / 1.1 µrad (with the floor: 39 / 23 / 20) | **Significant.** Ship DF fixes get 2–3× tighter, and most are now limited by the 20 µrad design floor. The station's 200 m array was already floor-limited and is unchanged. The database window's "DF σ at SNR 30" falls with it. |
| 3 | **Barrage spread** (`Effects.UPLINK_BAND_HZ`). The deep-space (Category B) X uplink is 7145–7190 MHz. 7190–7235 MHz is Category A. | 90 MHz, 19.54 dB | 45 MHz, 16.53 dB | **Significant.** Barrage jamming reaches 1.41× further (3 dB). Spot jamming is unchanged. |
| 4 | **Radar angle σ** (`Sensing.radar_angle_sigma`). Changed to the monopulse form. | θ3/√SNR | θ3/(1.6√(2 SNR)), 2.26× smaller | Moderate. Radar tracks get a tighter cross-range. Range (50 m) is unchanged. |
| 5 | **Lambert long-way transfers** (`Kepler.stumpff_c`, `stumpffC`). 1 − cos√z lost all precision as z → 4π², which made every transfer over 180° fail. The fix uses the half-angle form 2 sin²(√z/2)/z. | 63 of 129 test transfers had no solution, all those over 180°, including 27 of the 30 from WARDEN to campaign ships | All solved, within 1.9e-12 of Izzo | Moderate. Intercepts and pocket transfers that need the long way round are now possible. Any plan the game could already make is unchanged. |

**Accuracy fixes with no effect on balance:**

| # | What | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | Hyperbolic propagation over long coasts: the start of Newton's method now follows Vallado (2013) Algorithm 8 | 30-day hyperbolic coast diverged (\|r\| ≈ 10⁶² km) | 1.7e-13 relative |
| 7 | Kepler's equation for e near 1: Danby's starter, 50 iterations | e = 0.99, M = 11°: 83% position error | 5e-15 |
| 8 | 64-bit maths in place of Godot's 32-bit `Vector2` (laser spread, DF floor, tracker range measurement, bearing-fix normals) | Range measurement rounded to about 0.06 km at 10⁶ km (the size of the radar's σ); dazzle range out by 1e-7 | Double precision. Dazzle range 263,602.14 → 263,602.13 km |
| 9 | JS radar aperture efficiency 0.6 → 0.55, to match Godot and its database window | JS: 15,292 km on 0.5 m² | 14,641 km (same as Godot) |

**Source-audit fixes (25 Oct 2026):**

| # | What | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | **Reflected sunlight** (`Sensing.vis_mag`). A Lambert sphere's flux ratio is p·Φ(α)·r²/R² (Madhusudhan & Burrows 2012 eq. 3), with r² = A/4π for the hull's total area A. The game had p·(A/4)·Φ/R², the cross-section πr² in place of r²: π times (1.24 mag) too bright. `test_ir.py` had copied the same expression, so it could not catch it. | Visible 1 m detection ranges (thousand km): GADFLY 680, CROW 833, WREN 481, WARDEN 2,150, PFS 3,709, HMH-5 5,865 | 384, 470, 271, 1,213, 2,093, 3,309 (×0.564 = 1/√π). **Player-facing:** sunlit ships are found by telescope at a little over half the distance. |
| 11 | **Fragment area-to-mass** (`Breakup._draw_chi`). The bimodal large-object law holds above 11 cm only; between 8 and 11 cm the NASA Standard Breakup Model blends it linearly in λc with the small-object law (Frey & Colombo 2021, *JGCD* 44(1), App. B eqs. B5–B8). The minimum fragment size stays 0.10 m, so 0.10–0.11 m fragments now use the blend. | Bimodal law from 0.10 m | Blend between 8 and 11 cm. Small effect on play. |
| 12 | **Free-space loss reference** (`test_rf.py`, `published_values.json`). ITU-R P.525-4 eq. (4) uses 32.4, not 32.45; the game uses the exact eq. (3) form, 32.4478. | Test bound 0.005 dB against a misquoted 32.45 | Bound 0.05 dB against the published 32.4 (difference 0.048 dB). No game change. |
| 13 | **Aluminium specific heat** (`Thermal`, 897 J/(kg·K)) is now cited to NIST-JANAF (Chase 1998: 24.20 J/(mol·K) at 298 K). Incropera's Table A.1, cited before, gives 903 at 300 K. | — | No game change. |

Refactors that keep the public API: `Sensing.link_snr`, `Sensing.radar_snr`, `Sensing.radar_angle_sigma` and `Effects.kill_probability` were extracted from inline code so the suite can call them, and `RF.df_sigma` gained an optional `n = Bτ` argument.

| Element clock ignores leap seconds and TT − UTC | 69.2 s (Io 0.16°) | Bounded |
| IR: grey bodies in band (no spectral emissivity, no reflected sunlight in 6–10 µm, no specular glints) | Reflected sunlight is 0.24% of S in 6–10 µm (REALISM-SOURCES §2) | Design simplification |
| Radiators lie flat to the game's plane, so every observer sees their edge; temperatures change at once (no thermal lag) | — | Design simplification (stated in the simplifies note) |
| Visible telescopes look only where Blue holds a track (narrow-field imagers, ~100 s stares) | — | Design simplification |
| Red plans with S/N ≥ 5 (expected detection); Blue's looks roll Pd | — | Design simplification |
| **Fixed sidelobe and main-lobe gains** (−12 / 33 dBi, `towardUsDbi`) | — | **To be replaced by ITU envelopes, see REALISM-SOURCES §8** |
| Laser irradiance: P over the first-null disc (with jitter) | True on-axis peak is 2.3× higher (equivalent Strehl ratio 0.44); a perfect optic would dazzle out to about 399,000 km | Conservative, reported as INFO |
| Aperture efficiency 0.55 everywhere | 1.2 dB below DSN's 34 m | Conservative |
| No radar losses; detection on SNR alone | — | Design simplification |
| DF assumes broadside (σ grows as 1/cos θ off axis) and both elements of the array at the ES dish's gain | — | Design simplification |
| Kill-vehicle reach = divert × t/2; Pk uses the circular 1σ major axis | — | Design value (LORE) |
| HPM constant 30 for η₀/4π = 29.98 | 0.035% in reach | Bounded |
| ITU-R P.525-4 eq. (4)'s rounded 32.4 dB vs the exact eq. (3) constant 32.4478 dB | 0.048 dB | Bounded |

## For other owners

These are outside the files this pass owned. They are left for their owners:
- `godot/data/campaign.json`: three texts still say "uplink 7145–7235 MHz" or "barrage spreads it over 90 MHz" (`effects.jam.note`, `database.ccss.basis`, `sources.dsn810`).
- `godot/ui/database_window.gd` `_jam_line()` hard-codes `90e6` and "over 90 MHz". It should use `Effects.UPLINK_BAND_HZ`.
- `src/content/why.js` (`kepler3`) says the game moves the moons by T = 2π√(a³/GM). It now moves them at their observed rates; Kepler's law still agrees to 0.1%.
