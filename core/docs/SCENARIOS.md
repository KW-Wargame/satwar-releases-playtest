# xGEO Core: writing a scenario

A scenario is one JSON file: the platforms and equipment in play, where they
start, what Red does, and how the run ends. xGEO Core loads it on top of
`godot/data/game.json` (Jupiter, the moons, the sensor settings and a shared
set of classes) and runs it with no window through `godot/cli/run.gd`.

A complete, working example is
[`godot/data/examples/two_ships.json`](../godot/data/examples/two_ships.json):
a Blue weather satellite, a Blue warship and a Red inspector in low Jupiter
orbit. Every value in it is a design value (Notional). Copy it and change it.

A second example,
[`godot/data/examples/test_range.json`](../godot/data/examples/test_range.json)
(TEST RANGE), is the scenario Core's end-to-end test plays
(`godot/tests/scenario_test.gd`): every section on this page, an `effects`
block with the same design values as CLOSE PASS, and a Blue warship carrying
every sensor and effect. See *Testing a scenario* at the end.

The loader is `Sim._init` in `godot/core/sim.gd`; the end of the run is
`godot/core/campaign.gd`. This page describes what they read. Keys they do not
read are not listed.

## Fidelity of what you write

Your file feeds Real models (gravity, the radio and infrared equations, the
filter) with your own inputs. A class you invent, its sizes and powers, Red's
plan and the objectives are Notional: say so in a `note` (free text, ignored by
the loader). The labels are defined in [FIDELITY.md](FIDELITY.md).

## The file's sections

| Key | Required | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ships` | yes, in practice | | Every platform at the start. Without it the loader falls back to `game.json`'s own `scenario.ships`. |
| `classes` | no | | Classes of your own, by id. Added to `game.json`'s; the same id replaces `game.json`'s class. |
| `objectives` | yes, for a run that can end before `--hours` | | What Blue must do; which ones end the run. See *Objectives and how a run ends*. |
| `days` | no | days of sim time | The run ends with result `time` when this much sim time has passed. Without it, only the objectives (or `--hours`) end it. |
| `escalation` | if an objective is `peace` | | `war`: the escalation score (Notional) at which the `peace` objective fails. |
| `opening` | no | | Blue's first track on the Red ship whose id is `h1`. See *The opening track*. |
| `effects` | if anything uses an effect | | Settings for jamming, spoofing, dazzling, HPM, cyber, kinetic kills and radar (`effects.gd`). The CLI gives no orders, so a CLI run does not need them; xGEO Live and your own scripts that call `sim.effects` do. Copy the block from `examples/test_range.json`; CLOSE PASS (`godot/data/campaign.json`, in the full repository) carries the same values with notes giving each value's basis. |
| `civil` | no | | Neutral civil traffic, each one a radio emitter on a circular orbit. See *Civil traffic*. |
| `pockets`, `red`, `blue_extra` | no | | Lagrange-point pockets and Red ships placed in them, and Blue buoys staged behind a moon. CLOSE PASS (`campaign.json`) has pockets; no current scenario uses `red` or `blue_extra` (they came from the retired NIGHT HERON); see *Pockets*. |
| `interplanetary` | no | true / false | Allow flights between planets (`transfer.gd`). Default false. |
| `hulls` | no | | Hull drawings by class id, for xGEO Live only. Core gives a class with no hull an empty one. |
| `name` | no | | Printed in the CLI's `start` line. |
| `id`, `lost_advice`, `database`, `sources` | no | | Read by xGEO Live (tutorial choice, debrief, database window, sources), not by Core. |

Only `ships` and `classes` shape the world; the rest is bookkeeping.

## Placing ships

Each entry in `ships` is one platform:

| Key | Required | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | | Unique. `h1` is special (*The opening track*). |
| `classId` | yes | | A class from this file's `classes` or from `game.json`. |
| `side` | yes | `blue`, `red`, `neutral` | Blue is the U.S. Space Corps and its partners; Red is unflagged. Only Blue's ships sense; only Red and civil ships are listened to. |
| `kind` | yes | | What it is to the rules: `warship` (Red treats it as a threat; it can drop buoys), `commercial`, `station`, `hostile` for Red. A Red inspector backs off only from a Blue ship that is not a `station`, `buoy`, `kv` or `commercial`. |
| `name`, `short` | yes | | Long name, and the short one used in log lines. |
| `orbit` | one of three | see below | A circular orbit in the game's plane. |
| `r0`, `v0` | one of three | km, km/s | A state vector, Jupiter-centred, `[x, y, z]`. Set `t0: 0` with it. |
| `onMoon` | one of three | `io`, `europa`, `ganymede`, `callisto` | Fixed at that moon's centre and carried with it (a station). |
| `dry`, `prop` | no | tonnes | Override the class's dry and propellant mass. |
| `role` | Red only | | Red's behaviour. See *Red's behaviour*. |
| `plan` | with `role: shadow` | | Red's plan. |

Other fields (`registry`, `operator`, `flag`, `status`) are carried along for
xGEO Live's windows.

`orbit` is the easy way:

| Key | Required | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `radius_km` | yes | km from Jupiter's centre | Jupiter's radius is 71,492 km; the shipped scenario's low orbit is 92,940 km. |
| `phase_deg` | no, default 0 | degrees | Angle from the +x axis, counter-clockwise. Orbits are prograde (counter-clockwise). |
| `along_km` | no, default 0 | km | Moves the ship along the orbit: + ahead, − behind (an arc length on `radius_km`). |
| `radial_km` | no, default 0 | km | Moves it out (+) or in (−); the orbit is circular at the new radius. |

The speed is circular under the game's gravity, J2 included
(v² = μ/r + (3/2)μJ2R²/r³, `Sim._place`), so a ship placed this way coasts
round without a burn. Two ships at the same `radius_km` and `phase_deg` with
different `along_km` fly in formation; a small negative `radial_km` puts a ship
on a slightly faster, lower orbit, so it slowly catches up from behind. In the
example, the inspector starts 300 km behind and 10 km below its target, and
the warship 1,500 km behind and 40 km below.

## Classes: reuse or define

A ship's `classId` is looked up in one table: `game.json`'s classes with this
file's `classes` merged over them. So you can:

- **Reuse** a `game.json` class by id. Its ids are `sentinel` (Blue warship:
  infrared and optical telescopes, radio ears, radar, a nuclear-thermal drive),
  `pfs` (Blue protective-fires spacecraft), `station` (Blue surveillance site),
  `skv` (kill vehicle), `vesper` (Red covert tender), `hmh5` and `gmc2` (large
  civil hulls). The example's warship is a `sentinel`.
- **Define** your own under `classes`, as the example does for its satellite
  (`pelican`) and its inspector (`midge`). Copy the nearest existing class and
  change the values.
- **Replace** a `game.json` class by giving yours the same id. It replaces it
  for every ship in this run.

What a class needs:

| Key | Required | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | | Shown when a track is identified, and in the debrief. |
| `length` | yes | m | Sets how close a telescope must be to identify it. |
| `sig` | yes | `T` K, `eps`, `A` m², `alpha`, `diffuse` | Its skin for the heat model: temperature, emissivity, area, solar absorptance. |
| `rcs` | yes | m² | Radar cross-section. |
| `dry`, `prop` | with `engine` | tonnes | Masses, unless the ship sets them. |
| `engine` | to manoeuvre | `ve` km/s, `thrust` N, `hot` {`A` m², `T` K, `eps`} | Exhaust speed, thrust, and the hot drive the infrared sees while it burns. Δv follows the rocket equation. |
| `ir` | to see by infrared | `aperture` m, `nei`, `neiBand` W/m² | The telescope and its noise-equivalent irradiance. |
| `ttc` | to be heard | `f` Hz, `Pt` W, `dish` m, `bw` Hz, `burst` s, `every` [min, max] s, `aim`, `mod` | Its command and telemetry radio. `aim` is `handler` (Red's outpost by Callisto), `earth`, a moon id, or a ship id. `every` is how long it waits between reports. |
| `esm`, `radar`, `optical`, `thermal` | no | | Radio ears, radar, a visible telescope, a reactor and radiators: copy them from `sentinel` in `game.json`. |

A ship that needs none of the optional blocks (the example's `pelican`) is
only something to be seen and guarded.

## Red's behaviour

`role` picks Red's brain (`red_ai.gd`). The general-purpose one is `shadow`:
an uncooperative rendezvous and inspection of a Blue ship.

```json
"role": "shadow",
"plan": {"target": "pelican", "legs": [[-40, 1, 2], [-3, 2, 1.5]]}
```

`target` is the ship it inspects. Each leg is `[along-track km (+ ahead),
hours to hold there, hours to get there]`: it flies to that slot beside the
target (two burns, which its handler must command), holds, then takes the next
leg. After the last hold the inspection is complete and it leaves. Cut off from
its handler for 3 hours within 200 km of its target with a Blue ship within
25 km of it, it backs off to a higher orbit and departs (design values). If a
leg would cost more than 1/2.2 (about 45%) of its remaining Δv, it ends the
inspection there.

A Red ship with no `role` only reports home on its `ttc` schedule. The roles
`tender`, `relay`, `inspector` and `sleeper` are written for the shelved
scenario's ship ids (`h1`, `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, `excal`, `hydra`, `mv`) and are
not general-purpose.

## The opening track

If a Red ship has the id `h1`, Blue starts with a track on it, labelled
TRK 4417, drawn from its true state with this much error:

| Key | Default | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opening.sigma_km` | 3000 | km | 1σ position error of the first track. |
| `opening.sigma_kms` | 0.3 | km/s | 1σ velocity error. |
| `opening.cue` | | [plain, doctrinal] | The log line that says how it was cued. |

Any other Red ship starts unknown: Blue tracks it only once its own sensors
find it.

## Civil traffic

Each entry in `civil` is a neutral emitter on a circular, two-body orbit:
`id`, `class`, `name`, `short`, `radius_km`, `phase_deg`, optional `operator`
and `f` (Hz, its own channel; else the class's). Its class needs a `ttc`
block. Civil traffic is what makes Red's reports hard to pick out on the same
band.

## Pockets

`pockets` are places Red can hide: `{id, name, kind: "lagrange", moon, lead
(degrees, ±60 for L4/L5), size (km)}`. An entry in `red` places a Red ship in
one: `{id, name, short, class, role, pocket (an id, or a list to pick from by
the seed), offset: [x, y] km}`. A pocket counts as found when a classified
hostile track sits inside it with a 1σ ellipse smaller than its `size`. The
`lane` kind and `blue_extra` depend on the shelved scenario's freighter and
buoys.

## Objectives and how a run ends

Each objective is `{id, text, fail, advice}`:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Which test it runs (below). An id not in this list stays open forever. |
| `text` | yes | What it says; the reason given if it ends the run. |
| `fail` | yes | `true`: failing it ends the run, lost. `false`: it is only graded. |
| `advice` | no | Shown in the debrief if it failed. |

The tests (`Campaign.status`):

| `id` | Done when | Failed when |
|---|---|---|
| `signal` | a report from the `shadow` ship has been recorded and identified | never |
| `stop` | the `shadow` ship is out of the fight | it completed its inspection |
| `protect_sat` | the run is over | the `shadow` ship's `plan.target` is destroyed |
| `debris` | the run is over | any debris exists |
| `peace` | the run is over | escalation reaches `escalation.war` |
| `find` | every pocket holding Red is found | never |
| `protect`, `sleeper`, `excal` | | tied to the shelved scenario's ships |

Every look (600 s of sim time), the campaign checks, in this order:

1. The first objective with `fail: true` that has failed ends the run:
   result `lost`.
2. Every Red ship out of the fight (destroyed, captured, disabled, departed,
   given up or out of fuel) and every pocket holding Red found: result `won`.
3. `days` passed: result `time`.

So a scenario needs at least one Red ship: with none, the second test passes at
the first look and the run is won at once.

The CLI runs for `--hours` whatever happens, and stops early once the run is
over. It gives no orders: Blue's ships coast and sense, and Red follows its
plan. A CLI run of the example is therefore lost when the inspector finishes.
To play Blue, drive `Sim` from GDScript (`sim.execute(sim.plan_intercept(...))`,
`sim.effects`), as `godot/tests/` do.

## The seed

The seed drives every random draw: the opening track's error, sensor noise,
when Red reports home, which pocket a Red ship picks. It is `game.json`'s
`scenario.seed` (4417) unless `--seed=N` is given; a scenario file cannot set
it. The same file, seed and `--step` give the same output, line for line.

## Running it

Put the file under `godot/` and pass its `res://` path:

```sh
godot --headless --path godot --script res://cli/run.gd -- \
  --scenario=res://data/examples/two_ships.json --hours=8 --step=1800 --seed=7
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--scenario=` | `res://data/campaign.json` | The scenario. Empty runs `game.json` alone. |
| `--hours=` | 24 | Sim hours to run. |
| `--step=` | 600 | Seconds between `step` lines. The world acts every 600 s look whatever this is. |
| `--seed=` | `game.json`'s | The random seed. |
| `--out=` | standard output | Write the lines to this file. |
| `--truth=` | false | Also report Red's and neutrals' true states. |

Godot prints its banner, and at exit some leaked-resource errors, around the
JSON; keep only the lines that start with `{`. Mistakes do not always stop
the run: a `classId` that does not exist prints a `SCRIPT ERROR` on standard
error, that ship is left out, and the run goes on without it. Check standard
error for `SCRIPT ERROR` after every change.

## Reading the output

One JSON object per line. Units are km, km/s and s, Jupiter-centred, in the
game's plane; `t` is sim seconds from the start.

- `start`: the scenario, its `name`, the seed, the start time (UTC), hours and
  step.
- `step`, one per `--step`: `t` and `utc`; `escalation`; `ships`, Blue's (all
  of them with `--truth=true`) with position `r`, velocity `v` and remaining
  `delta_v`; `tracks`, Blue's belief about each contact, never the truth:
  `label`, `ident` (`unknown` until identified), `side`, `class`, `in_contact`,
  `last_seen`, `r`, `v` and the 1σ position ellipse `sigma_km` (`major`,
  `minor` in km, `angle` in radians); and `log`, every log entry since the last
  line, each with its own `t`, a stable `code`, a `kind` (info, good, warn,
  alert) and the `text`.
- `end`: the last `t`, `over`, `result` (`won`, `lost`, `time`, or empty if
  `--hours` ran out first) and the `debrief`: each objective's state, each Red
  ship's fate, escalation and debris.

From the command above (seed 7), trimmed: positions, velocities and the second
Blue ship are cut, and `…` marks a cut.

```json
{"engine":"xGEO Core","hours":8.0,"name":"TWO SHIPS","scenario":"res://data/examples/two_ships.json","seed":7,"step":1800.0,"type":"start","units":{"distance":"km","speed":"km/s","time":"s"},"utc":"2041-10-12T16:10:00Z"}

```

Read it as: Blue holds the opening track; the inspector felt hunted by the
warship closing from behind and went quiet at 600 s, burned at 1,200 s, parked
40 km behind PELICAN-3, moved in to 3 km, and at 24,000 s finished. `stop` had
`fail: true`, so the run was lost at that look; the CLI's last step closed at
25,200 s. The track's 1σ ellipse is long and thin (62 km by 2 km): bearings
from one telescope pin the direction well and the range poorly.

Two things the output does not say directly. The opening cue is logged while
the scenario loads, before the first line, so it never appears. And the moment
the run ended is the `t` of the log line that ended it, not the `end` line's
`t`, which is the last step boundary.

## Testing a scenario

`godot/tests/scenario_test.gd` plays TEST RANGE through every part of Core and
checks that the parts agree; copy it to check a scenario of your own:

```sh
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/scenario_test.gd
```

It checks that the scenario loads (every ship, a station riding its moon, the
civil emitter, the opening track); that the same seed gives the same world to
the last digit and another seed does not; two days of flight (every state
finite, nothing inside Jupiter, an unmanoeuvred orbit keeping its size); that
bursts are heard, classified and direction-found by two ears, and that the
track on the inspector stays honest (the truth inside 4σ of its own estimate);
that Jupiter hides a ship on its far side; a planned transfer arriving within
50 km; each effect against its formula (HPM reach √(30PG)/E, the laser's
irradiance at its dazzle reach, Pk, the jammer's reach) and in use, with its
escalation and the laser's waste heat; a kill vehicle breaking up a 0.5 t
inspector and only cratering a 60 t tender (the NASA breakup model's 40 J/g);
the objectives, the end of the operation and the debrief; a save that loads
back bit for bit and runs on alike; the command-line runner's JSON lines; and
that a finished world is freed. Its thresholds (4σ, 50 km, 2%) are design
values for a test, chosen with margin over what the models give.
